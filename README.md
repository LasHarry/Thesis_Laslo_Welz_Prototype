GitHub Repository created by [Laslo Welz](https://github.com/LasHarry/)

## Introduction

The prototype was build in a Linux enivronment using [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/wsl/about).
This is recommended for using the ColBERT library. To run the scripts, it is recommended to train the model on a GPU using the Nvidia CUDA environment.
For the exact library check out this [config file](conda_env.yml)
